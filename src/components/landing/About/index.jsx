            Hello, my name is Augusto Carlos Pereira da Silva, I'm a software
            developer , computer science student and a technology enthusiast
            around the programming universe with a focus on the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            My current choice of tools and languages is trending toward
            Typescript(Node/ReactJS), Go and Flutter. My fields of interest and
            domain knowledge span networking, infrastructure and security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Innovation and creativity are what drive me while i'm writting
            appsâš¡. In addition to programming, I really like books and music,
            and sometimes drawing to pass the time.
          </p>
