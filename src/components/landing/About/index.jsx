            Hello, my name is Augusto da Silva, I'm a web
            developer , computer science student and a technology enthusiast
            around the programming universe with a focus on the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            My current choice of tools and languages is trending toward
            Typescript(Node/Angular), ReactJS, and Flutter. My fields of
            interest and domain knowledge span Web services, SEO and UI/UX
            Design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Security, innovation and creativity are what drive me while i'm
            writting appsâš¡. In addition to programming, I really like books and
            music, and sometimes drawing to pass the time.
          </p>
